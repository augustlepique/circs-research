# CIRCS Research

## Overview
This repository contains code, notebooks, and analysis related to my CIRCS research. The goal of this project is to
1) Establish an accessible database of historic winter SCS events that assesses location and intensity, frequency, and trends in compound hazards with SCS
2) Assess the local environment, climate variability, and trends to understand the processes that conspire to produce the growing winter SCS threat.
3) Quanitfy changes in probability and uncertainty in the synoptic-environment, climate variability, and trends in SCS and compound events in winter to better understand future events.
